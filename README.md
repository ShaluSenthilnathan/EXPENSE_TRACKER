# EXPENSE TRACKER
The Expense Tracker project is designed to help users keep track of their expenses. It allows users to input their net income, various sources of income, and monthly expenses.

Whenever a user makes an expenditure entry, the corresponding amount is deducted from their net amount.This enables users to view their past expenses and make informed decisions to reduce expenses in the future.
